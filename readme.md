## To Get Started

Inside you 'group-projects' directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/swellander/kathy.git
```
```
cd kathy
```

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Don't forget:
Whenever you come back to the project, before making any new changes run `git pull origin master` from your master branch to make sure that your version is in sync with everyone else's.
